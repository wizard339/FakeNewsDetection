## Usage

- Clone my repository.
- Load `model.pkl` from `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IYza8I4hY0GielDLMl6t9Px2akWf1zDb/view?usp=sharing` and place the file to the working directory.
- Open CMD in working directory.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Open project in any IDE (Pycharm or VSCode)
- Run `main.py`, go to the `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
- If you want to build your model with the some changes, you can check the `model.ipynb`.
- You can check that the web application is working fine. Sometimes classifications can be wrong.

## Note
- This project was created for educational purposes.
- The model can show the best results on texts with a length from 7 to 65 words, because it was on such data that it was trained.
- Ð¡lassification results may be inaccurate, so you need to treat them with caution.
